Welcome to Stamp.com ReadMe! If you're here you're either lost or you already know what time it is. ReadMe will be updated weekly with a weekly progress update. When I get better at this it won't look so hood but for now, minimal format.

Ok, it is recommended that you download bootstrap if you intend to format any code. You can go to this link: https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/download/. I picked bootstrap because I thought it would be easy to code a website that wasn't complete trash on mobile phones and it seems to be working pretty aight right now. 

I accept all input in regards to orginization, I'm trash at it but I'm gonna give it a shot.
